    <h2>Early Developments (1984-1987)</h2>
    <p>Verilog was initially developed by Phil Moorby and others at Gateway Design Automation in the early 1980s. It gained popularity as a hardware description language during this period.</p>

    <h2>IEEE Standardization (1987-1995)</h2>
    <p>In 1987, Verilog was standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as IEEE Standard 1364-1995. This standardization played a crucial role in its widespread adoption.</p>

    <h2>Growth and Industry Adoption (1995-2000)</h2>
    <p>Verilog became the industry standard for hardware description, experiencing significant growth in usage within the semiconductor industry. Electronic design automation (EDA) tools increasingly incorporated Verilog support.</p>

    <h2>SystemVerilog and Extensions (2002-2009)</h2>
    <p>SystemVerilog, introduced in the early 2000s, extended Verilog's capabilities, particularly in verification and system-level design. The IEEE Standard 1800-2009 for SystemVerilog further enhanced the language.</p>

    <h2>Recent Developments (2010-Present)</h2>
    <p>Verilog and SystemVerilog continue to evolve, integrating with modern design methodologies. Ongoing advancements ensure their relevance in electronic design and verification.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The history of Verilog showcases its journey from early developments to becoming a standard in electronic design. Its impact on hardware description and verification remains significant.</p>
